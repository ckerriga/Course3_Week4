# Course3_Week4

This is the README file for the Course 3, Week 4 final programming assignment.

Included in this repo are two files: run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md. See below for a description of each file.

1) run_analysis.R - This is the R file that completes 5 primary steps:
  1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
  This file is also annotated and shows where each of these steps is being performed.
  
2) CodeBook.md - this is the code book for the run_analysis.R file mentioned above. This document describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
